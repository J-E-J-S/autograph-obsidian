    "The present review represents an update on the fundamental role played by the Rho factor, which facilitates the process of Rho-dependent transcription termination in the prokaryotic world; it also provides a summary of relevant mutations in the Rho factor and the insights they provide into the functions carried out by this protein. Furthermore, a section is dedicated to the putative future use of Rho (the 'taming' of Rho) to facilitate biotechnological processes and adapt them to different technological contexts. Novel bacterial strains can be designed, containing mutations in the rho gene, that are better suited for different biotechnological applications. This process can obtain novel microbial strains that are adapted to lower temperatures of fermentation, shorter production times, exhibit better nutrient utilization, or display other traits that are beneficial in productive Biotechnology. Additional important issues reviewed here include epistasis, the design of TATA boxes, the role of small RNAs, and the manipulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, by some pathogenic bacteria, to invade eukaryotic cells. KEY POINTS: • It is postulated that controlling the action of the prokaryotic Rho factor could generate major biotechnological improvements, such as an increase in bacterial productivity or a reduction of the microbial-specific growth rate. • The review also evaluates the putative impact of epistatic mechanisms on Biotechnology, both as possible responsible for unexpected failures in gene cloning and more important for the genesis of new strains for biotechnological applications • The use of clathrin-coated vesicles by intracellular bacterial microorganisms is included too and proposed as a putative delivery mechanism, for drugs and vaccines."
