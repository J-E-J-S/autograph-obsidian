    "Non-conventional yeasts refer to a huge and still poorly explored group of species alternative to the well-known model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among them, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and the sister species Zygosaccharomyces bailii are infamous for spoiling food and beverages even in presence of several food preservatives. On the other hand, their capability to cope with a wide range of process conditions makes these yeasts very attractive factories (the so-called \"ZygoFactories\") for bio-converting substrates poorly permissive for the growth of other species. In balsamic vinegar Z. rouxii is the main yeast responsible for converting highly concentrated sugars into ethanol, with a preference for fructose over glucose (a trait called fructophily). Z. rouxii has also attracted much attention for the ability to release important flavor compounds, such as fusel alcohols and the derivatives of 4-hydroxyfuranone, which markedly contribute to fragrant and smoky aroma in soy sauce. While Z. rouxii was successfully proposed in brewing for producing low ethanol beer, Z. bailii is promising for lactic acid and bioethanol production. Recently, several research efforts exploited omics tools to pinpoint the genetic bases of distinctive traits in \"ZygoFactories\", like fructophily, tolerance to high concentrations of sugars, lactic acid and salt. Here, I provided an overview of Zygosaccharomyces industrially relevant phenotypes and summarized the most recent findings in disclosing their genetic bases. I suggest that the increasing number of genomes available for Z. rouxii and other Zygosaccharomyces relatives, combined with recently developed genetic engineering toolkits, will boost the applications of these yeasts in biotechnology and applied microbiology."
