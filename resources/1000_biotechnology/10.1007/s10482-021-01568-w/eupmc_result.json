    "A novel Gram-negative, rod-shaped, aerobic, oxidase-positive and catalase-negative bacterium, designated strain SM1970<sup>T</sup>, was isolated from a seawater sample collected from the Mariana Trench. Strain SM1970<sup>T</sup> grew at 15-37 <sup>o</sup>C and with 1-5% (w/v) NaCl. It hydrolyzed colloidal chitin, agar and casein but did not reduce nitrate to nitrite. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain SM1970<sup>T</sup> formed a distinct lineage close to the genus Catenovulum within the family Alteromonadaceae, sharing the highest sequence similarity (93.6%) with type strain of Catenovulum maritimum but < 93.0% sequence similarity with those of other known species in the class Gammaproteobacteria. The major fatty acids of strain SM1970<sup>T</sup> were summed feature 3 (C<sub>16: 1 </sub>ω7c and/or C<sub>16: 1 </sub>ω6c), C<sub>16: 0</sub> and summed feature 8 (C<sub>18: 1 </sub>ω7c and/or C<sub>18: 1 </sub>ω6c). The major polar lipids of the strain included phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol and its main respiratory quinone was ubiquinone 8. The draft genome of strain SM1970<sup>T</sup> consisted of 77 scaffolds and was 4,172,146 bp in length, containing a complete set of genes for chitin degradation. The average amino acid identity (AAI) values between SM1970<sup>T</sup> and type strains of known Catenovulum species were 56.6-57.1% while the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) values between them were 28.5-31.5%. The genomic DNA G + C content of strain SM1970<sup>T</sup> was 40.1 mol%. On the basis of the polyphasic analysis, strain SM1970<sup>T</sup> is considered to represent a novel species in a novel genus of the family Alteromonadaceae, for which the name Marinifaba aquimaris is proposed with the type strain being SM1970<sup>T</sup> (= MCCC 1K04323<sup>T</sup> = KCTC 72844<sup>T</sup>)."
