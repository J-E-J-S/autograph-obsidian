    "Pharmaceutical active drug(s) especially sulfamethazine (SMZ) is considered as one of the major emerging microcontaminants due its long-term existence in the environmental system and that can influence on the developmental of antibacterial resistance genes. Because of this region it has a great concern in the aquatic system. Moreover, the vast utilization of SMZ, excretion of undigested portion by animals and also through dumping or mishandling, SMZ is frequently detected in various samples (including water) of different places and its surroundings. Additionally, reports shown it has toxic effect against microalgae and mice. Thus, that can lead to several investigators, focusing on removal of SMZ alone or in combination of other drugs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) either by abiotic and/or biotic treatment methods. The present review provides an overview of the toxic effect of SMZ and SMZ degradation/removal in abiotic and biotic processes. Finally, reveals the need of further implication of integrated treatments (including engineered biological mediators) to understand ideal biological approaches for the mineralization of SMZ."
