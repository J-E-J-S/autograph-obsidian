    "Extracellular and cell-bound lipase-producing yeasts were isolated from the palm oil mill wastes and investigated for their potential uses as biocatalysts in biodiesel production. Twenty-six yeast strains were qualitatively screened as lipase producers. From those yeast strains, only six were selected and screened further for quantitative lipase production.The phylogenetic affiliations of the yeast strains were confirmed by investigating the D1/D2 domains of 26S rDNA and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 molecular regions of the six yeast strains selected as potent lipase producers. The three yeast strains A4C, 18B, and 10F showed a close association with Magnusiomyces capitatus. Two yeast strains (17B and AgB) had a close relationship with Saprochaete clavata, whereas the strain AW2 was identified as Magnusiomyces spicifer. Three main catalytic activities of the yeast lipases were evaluated and Magnusiomyces capitatus A4C, among the selected lipase-producing yeasts, had the highest extracellular lipolytic enzyme activity (969 U/L) with the cell-bound lipolytic enzyme activity of 11.3 U/gdm. The maximum cell-bound lipolytic activity (12.4 U/gdm) was observed in the cell-bound lipase fraction produced by Magnusiomyces spicifer AW2 with an extracellular lipolytic enzyme activity of 886 U/L. Based on the specific hydrolytic enzymatic activities, the cell-bound lipases (CBLs) from the three yeast strains M. capitatus A4C, M. spicifer AW2, and Saprochaete clavata 17B were further investigated for biodiesel production. Among them, the CBL from M. spicifer AW2 synthesized the most FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) at 81.2% within 12 h indicating that it has potential for application in enzymatic biodiesel production."
