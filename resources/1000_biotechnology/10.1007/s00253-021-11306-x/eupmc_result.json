    "Steviol glycosides (SvGls) are plant secondary metabolites belonging to a class of chemical compounds known as diterpenes. SvGls have been discovered only in a few plant species, including in the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni. Over the last few decades, SvGls have been extensively researched for their extraordinary sweetness. As a result, the nutritional and pharmacological benefits of these secondary metabolites have grown increasingly apparent. In the near future, SvGls may become a basic, low-calorie, and potent sweetener in the growing natural foods market, and a natural anti-diabetic remedy, a highly competitive alternative to commercially available synthetic drugs. Commercial cultivation of stevia plants and the technologies of SvGls extraction and purification from plant material have already been introduced in many countries. However, new conventional and biotechnological solutions are still being sought to increase the level of SvGls in plants. Since many aspects related to the biochemistry and metabolism of SvGls in vivo, as well as their relationship to the overall physiology of S. rebaudiana are not yet understood, there is also a great need for in-depth scientific research on this topic. Such research may have positive impact on optimization of the profile and SvGls concentration in plants and thus lead to obtaining desired yield. This research summarizes the latest approaches and developments in SvGls production. KEY POINTS: • Steviol glycosides (SvGls) are found in nature in S. rebaudiana plants. • They exhibit nutraceutical properties. • This review provides an insight on different approaches to produce SvGls. • The areas of research that still need to be explored have been identified."
