    "Billions of tons of keratinous waste in the form of feathers, antlers, bristles, claws, hair, hoofs, horns, and wool are generated by different industries and their demolition causes environmental deterioration. Chicken feathers have 92% keratin that can be a good source of peptides, amino acids, and minerals. Traditional methods of feather hydrolysis require large energy inputs, and also reduce the content of amino acids and net protein utilization values. Biological treatment of feathers with keratinolytic microbes is a feasible and environmental favorable preference for the formulation of hydrolysate that can be used as bioactive peptides, protein supplement, livestock feed, biofertilizer, etc. The presence of amino acids, soluble proteins, and peptides in hydrolysate facilitates the growth of microbes in rhizosphere that promotes the uptake and utilization of nutrients from soil. Application of hydrolysate enhances water holding capacity, C/N ratio, and mineral content of soil. The plant growth promoting activities of hydrolysate potentiates its possible use in organic farming, and improves soil ecosystem and microbiota. This paper reviews the current scenario on the methods available for management of keratinous waste, nutritional quality of hydrolysate generated using keratinolytic microbes, and its possible application as plant growth promoter in agroindustry."
