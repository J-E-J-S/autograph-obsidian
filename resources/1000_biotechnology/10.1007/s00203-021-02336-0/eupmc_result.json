    "Under the influence of electromagnetic waves of millimeter range with the frequency of 51.8 GHz, changes in the morphology, growth parameters and mitotic activity of yeasts C. guilliermondii NP-4 are revealed. Filamentous and giant cells appeared in a population of exposed yeasts. The sigmoid shape of the growth curve remained but the lag phase duration was increased by 2 h in comparison with non-exposed yeasts; accordingly, the log and stationary phases followed 2 h later. The specific growth rate in the log growth phase and colony-forming ability of exposed yeasts was decreased. It is suggested that yeasts have some response mechanisms to 51.8-GHz frequency electromagnetic waves. The results can be used to understand the response mechanisms of microorganisms to non-ionizing radiation, as well as to develop approaches to protect living organisms from it. The effect of electromagnetic waves of 51.8-GHz frequency to suppress yeasts can be applied in biotechnology and medicine."
