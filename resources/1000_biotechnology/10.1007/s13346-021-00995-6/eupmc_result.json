    "Along with the evolutionary breakthrough of RNA interference and the applicability for gene knockdown, a subsequent development in siRNA-based therapeutics has been attained. The gene therapy based on RNAi is in transition progress from the research aspects to clinical base. Being a potent tool, siRNA is used as therapeutic against several disorders. Cancer which is one of the deadliest diseases is now treated with an advanced mechanism of siRNA delivery inside the genome, leading to gene silencing; thereby, blocking translation of gene to form protein. siRNA tool delivers remedial effects with the advantages of safe delivery and efficiency. Despite its merits, barriers including instability at physiological conditions, lack of ability to cross biological membranes, off-targets, and safety are also associated with siRNA delivery system. The gene silencing efficiency values both in vitro and in vivo reported in the past years have been reviewed by material type (lipid, polymer, silica, porous silicon, and metal). This review presents a deep insight in the development of targeted delivery of siRNA. Since several clinical trials have also been performed regarding the siRNA delivery against cancer, it can also be stated that the delivery system should be good enough to achieve effective siRNA drug development."
