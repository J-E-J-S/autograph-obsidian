    "The emerging technique of microfluidics offers new approaches for precisely controlling fluidic conditions on a small scale, while simultaneously facilitating data collection in both high-throughput and quantitative manners. As such, the so-called lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems have the potential to revolutionize the field of biotechnology. But what needs to happen in order to truly integrate them into routine biotechnological applications? In this chapter, some of the most promising applications of microfluidic technology within the field of biotechnology are surveyed, and a few strategies for overcoming current challenges posed by microfluidic LOC systems are examined. In addition, we also discuss the intensifying trend (across all biotechnology fields) of using point-of-use applications which is being facilitated by new technological achievements."
