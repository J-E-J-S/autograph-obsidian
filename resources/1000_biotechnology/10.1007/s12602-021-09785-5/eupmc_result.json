    "Regulation of immune responses is among the beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria on human health. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of normal and heat-shocked Lactobacillus plantarum PTCC 1058 cell lysate on cytokine expression by human PBMCs. The mid-exponential phase L. plantarum (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) were used to prepare cell lysate. Isolated PBMCs were stimulated with 100 µg/mL of each normal and heat-shocked L. plantarum cell lysate for 72 h. Non-stimulated PBMCs were also evaluated as negative control. The mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-10, IFN-ɣ, TNF-α, and TGF-β genes was determined by quantitative RT-PCR amplification of total RNA extracted from PBMCs. Both types of cell lysate were able to increase pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, this effect was significantly stronger in heat-shocked cell lysate-treated PBMCs. Moreover, comparison of IFN-ɣ/IL-10, IFN-ɣ/TGF-β, IL-6/IL-10, IL-6/TGF-β, and TNF-α/IL-10 ratios in both conditions demonstrated that in the heat-shocked group, all of the above ratios were significantly higher than normal lysate treatment (p˂0.001), suggesting that heat-shocked probiotics are a potent inducer of the immune system in comparison to intact probiotics. Regarding these results, it may be possible to develop a new postbiotic product for the stimulation of immune responses of cancer patients or individuals who suffer from an immune defect."
