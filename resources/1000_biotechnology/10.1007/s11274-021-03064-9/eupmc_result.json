    "Bacterial lipopeptides have become a research focus of many studies owing to their industrial and pharmaceutical importance. Although such studies focused on researching purification procedures and qualitative analysis, much remains to be explored and developed to improve the current methods. To enable thorough studies of lipopeptides, this paper describes a new method for purification and characterization of in-gel anionic lipopeptides. Specifically, lipopeptides attributed to the anti-staphylococcal activity of Bacillus mojavensis HF were separated using SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and subsequently characterized using mass spectrometry. Lipopeptide band obtained by gel electrophoresis was first visualized using three different staining methods. Next, the lipopeptide isomers were efficiently recovered from the gel band and structural characterization of the extracted lipopeptides was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). MS analysis revealed that Bacillus mojavensis HF produced three types of lipopeptides including surfactin, fengycin, and kurstakin. 14 clusters of ion peaks were identified as fengycin A with fatty acid of C15-C17, fengycin B (C16, C17), surfactin (C13-C16), and kurstakin (C9-C12). Moreover, tandem mass spectrometric analysis (MS/MS) revealed the sequences of fengycin A and surfactin. In this study, we identified a high variety and number of surfactin and fengycin isomers, which previous reports lacked. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the presence of kurstakin in Bacillus mojavensis species. Finally, we demonstrated that our gel-based study of lipopeptides allowed for a precise and reproducible investigation of these molecules."
