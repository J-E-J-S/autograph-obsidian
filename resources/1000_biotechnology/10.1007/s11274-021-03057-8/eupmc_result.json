    "Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as 'citrus greening', is an extremely destructive disease of citrus worldwide. HLB is associated with three species of the fastidious proteobacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas), Ca. L. africanus and Ca. L. americanus with CaLas being the most widely distributed around the world and the only species detected and described so far in India, one of the major global citrus fruit producers. Prophages are highly dynamic components in the bacterial genome and play an important role in intraspecies variations. Three types of prophages, Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 have been identified and described in CaLas so far. In the present study, 441 CaLas isolates sampled across 18 Indian states were used for prophage typing. Based on detection of three prophage types by PCR, all the eight probable combinations of CaLas prophages were identified, including single Type 1 (26.5%), single Type 2 (18.8%), single Type 3 (1.4%), Type 1 + Type 2 (20.4%), Type 1 + Type 3 (12.5%), Type 2 + Type 3 (4.8%), Type 1 + Type 2 + Type 3 (11.3%) and None type (4.3%). Prophage types were confirmed by PCR amplicon sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. By discovery of all 3 prophages and based on genetic identity and genetic distance, CaLas populations from eighteen citrus growing states were separated into two major Prophage Typing Groups (PTGs): PTG1 and PTG2. The PTG1 comprised of CaLas from North-West India and PTG2 from rest of the country (North-East, Central and South India), and both major groups were further divided into two (PTG1-A, PTG1-B) and three (PTG2-A, PTG2-B and PTG2-C) subgroups respectively. The findings of CaLas population patterns provide evidence for independent origins of HLB-associated CaLas. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) array was also detected in CaLas isolates. This is the first report evaluating the genetic variation of a large population of CaLas bacterium in India using the PCR markers from the prophage regions which would certainly assist the ongoing HLB management efforts in India."
