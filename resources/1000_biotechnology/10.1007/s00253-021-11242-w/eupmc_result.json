    "Carbamoyl phosphate is an important precursor for L-arginine and pyrimidines biosynthesis. In view of this importance, the cell factory should enhance carbamoyl phosphate synthesis to improve related compound production. In this work, we verified that carbamoyl phosphate is essential for L-arginine production in Corynebacterium sp., followed by engineering of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis for further strain improvement. First, carAB encoding carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II was overexpressed to improve the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate. Second, the regulation of glutamine synthetase increases the supply of L-glutamine, providing an effective substrate for carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II. Third, carbamate kinase, which catalyzes inorganic ammonia synthesis carbamoyl phosphate, was screened and selected to assist in carbamoyl phosphate supply. Finally, we disrupted ldh (encoding lactate dehydrogenase) to decrease by-production formation and save NADH to regenerate ATP through the electron transport chain. Subsequently, the resulting strain allowed a dramatically increased L-arginine production of 68.6 ± 1.2 g∙L<sup>-1</sup>, with an overall productivity of 0.71 ± 0.01 g∙L<sup>-1</sup>∙h<sup>-1</sup> in 5-L bioreactor. Stepwise rational metabolic engineering based on an increase in the supply of carbamoyl phosphate resulted in a gradual increase in L-arginine production. The strategy described here can also be implemented to improve L-arginine and pyrimidine derivatives. KEY POINTS: • The L-arginine production strongly depended on the supply of carbamoyl phosphate. • The novel carbamoyl phosphate synthesis pathway for C. crenatum based on carbamate kinase was first applied to L-arginine synthesis. • ATP was regenerated followed with the disruption of lactate formation."
