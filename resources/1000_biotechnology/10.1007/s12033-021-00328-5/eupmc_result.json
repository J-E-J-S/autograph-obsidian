    "Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), a sugar crop commonly grown for sugar production all over the world, is susceptible to several insect pests attack in addition to bacterial, fungal and viral infections leading to substantial reductions in its yield. The complex genetic makeup and lack of resistant genes in genome of sugarcane have made the conventional breeding a difficult and challenging task for breeders. Using pesticides for control of the attacking insects can harm beneficial insects, human and other animals and the environment as well. As alternative and effective strategy for control of insect pests, genetic engineering has been applied for overexpression of cry proteins, vegetative insecticidal proteins (vip), lectins and proteinase inhibitors (PI). In addition, the latest biotechnological tools such as host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) and CRISPR/Cas9 can be employed for sustainable control of insect pests in sugarcane. In this review overexpression of the cry, vip, lectins and PI genes in transgenic sugarcane and their disease resistance potential is described."
