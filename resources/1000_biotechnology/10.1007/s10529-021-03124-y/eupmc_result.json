    "<h4>Objective</h4>Identification and characterization of a novel thermostable amidase (Xam) with wide pH tolerance and broad-spectrum substrate specificity.<h4>Results</h4>Xam was identified from non-thermophilic Xinfangfangia sp. DLY26 and its acyl transfer activity was investigated. Recombinant Xam was optimally active at 60 °C and pH 9.0. The enzyme had a half life of 18 h at 55 °C and maintained more than 60 % of its maximum activity in the range of pH 3.0-11.0. Additionally, Xam exhibited broad substrate specificity towards aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic amides.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These unique properties make Xam a promising biocatalyst for production of important hydroxamic acids at elevated temperatures."
