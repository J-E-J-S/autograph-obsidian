    "Streptomyces have been reported as a remarkable source for bioactive secondary metabolites with complex structural and functional diversity. In this study, 35 isolates of genus Streptomyces were purified from rhizospheric and marine soils collected from previously unexplored habitats and screened for antimicrobial activities. One of these isolates, G1, when tested in vitro, was found highly active against wide range of microbes including Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and different fungal pathogens. It was identified as mesophilic, alkaliphilic, and moderately halotolerant as it showed optimum growth at temperature 30 °C, pH 8.0 in casein-starch-peptone-yeast extract-malt extract medium supplemented with 5% NaCl. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene indicated 100% identity of this isolate to Streptomyces fimbriatus. Moreover, maximum antimicrobial activity was achieved in starch nitrate medium supplemented with 1% glycerol as carbon and 0.03% soy meal as nitrogen source. The antimicrobial compounds produced by this isolate were extracted in methanol. Bioassay-guided fractionation through thin layer chromatography of methanolic extract resulted in the separation of a most active fraction with an R<sub>f</sub> value of 0.46. This active fraction was characterized by FTIR and LCMS analysis and found similar to streptothricin D like antibiotic with m/z 758.42."
