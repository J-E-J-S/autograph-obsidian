    "<h4>Introduction</h4>Drug repurposing is the need of the hour considering the medical emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the 'Cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations.<h4>Results</h4>Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study provides an insight into the drug repurposing approach in which several FDA approved drugs were examined to inhibit COVID-19 infection by targeting the main protease of SARS-COV-2 and the cytokine storm."
