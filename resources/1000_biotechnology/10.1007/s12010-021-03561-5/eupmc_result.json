    "Ni<sup>2+</sup>-functionalized porous ceramic/agarose composite beads (Ni-NTA Cerose) can be used as carrier materials to immobilize enzymes harboring a metal affinity tag. Here, a 6×His-tag fusion alcohol dehydrogenase Mu-S5 and glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium (BmGDH) were co-immobilized on Ni-NTA Cerose to construct a packed bed reactor (PBR) for the continuous synthesis of the chiral intermediate (S)-(4-chlorophenyl)-(pyridin-2-yl) methanol ((S)-CPMA) NADPH recycling, and in situ product adsorption was achieved simultaneously by assembling a D101 macroporous resin column after the PBR. Using an optimum enzyme activity ratio of 2:1 (Mu-S5: BmGDH) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as co-solvent, a space-time yield of 1560 g/(L·d) could be achieved in the first three days at a flow rate of 5 mL/min and substrate concentration of 10 mM. With simplified selective adsorption and extraction procedures, (S)-CPMA was obtained in 84% isolated yield."
