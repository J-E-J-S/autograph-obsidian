    "Wheat is the core food crop in bioregenerative life support systems (BLSSs). In confined isolation environments, wheat growth suffers from a lack of stable microbial communities and is susceptible to pathogenic infections due to the culture substrate's limitations. To overcome this limitation, the time series changes of wheat rhizosphere microorganisms in wheat production must be understood. In the present study, we examined the rhizosphere microbial samples from wheat at four different growth stages from plants collected from a BLSS plant cabin. We employed bioinformatics analysis strategies to analyze the characteristics of species composition, function prediction, and community network. The species composition of wheat rhizosphere microorganisms was relatively stable in the seedling, tillering, and flowering stages in confined isolation environments. However, we observed marked microbial changes at mature stages. The results of functional prediction analysis suggest that the rhizosphere microbial community function of \"Energy metabolism\" gradually decreased, and the function of \"Transmembrane transport\" gradually increased during wheat development. The construction of the rhizosphere microbial community is non-random, scale-free and has the characteristics of a small world. We found the tillering stage to be more complex than the other stages. Our study reveals the composition characteristics, functional changes, and community structure fluctuations of rhizosphere bacteria at different development stages of wheat in the isolated and controlled environment, providing a theoretical basis for the efficient production of BLSS plant systems. KEY POINTS: • We collected wheat rhizosphere microorganisms at different stages in a confined isolation environment. • The diversity, composition, function, and network structure of rhizosphere bacteria were analyzed. • The effect of different wheat stages on the composition, function, and network structure of rhizosphere microorganisms was speculated."
