    "<h4>Objectives</h4>This study was aimed at engineering charged residues on the surface of Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) to obtain TLL variant with elevated performance for industrial applications.<h4>Results</h4>Site-directed mutagenesis of eight charged amino acids on the TLL surface were conducted and substitutions on the negatively charged residues D111, D158, D165, and E239 were identified with elevated specific activities and biodiesel yields. Synergistic effect was not discovered in the double mutants, D111E/D165E and D165E/E239R, when compared with the corresponding single mutants. One TLL mutant, D165E, was identified with increased specific activity (456.60 U/mg), catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>: 44.14 s<sup>-1</sup> mM<sup>-1</sup>), the highest biodiesel conversion yield (93.56%), and comparable thermostability with that of the TLL.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study highlighted the importance of surface charge engineering in improving TLL activity and biodiesel production, and the resulting TLL mutant, D165E, is a promising candidate for biodiesel industry."
