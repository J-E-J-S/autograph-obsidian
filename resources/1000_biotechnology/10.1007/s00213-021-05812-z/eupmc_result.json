    "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction and restrictive, repetitive, and stereotypical patterns of behavior. However, there is no pharmacological drug that is currently used to target these core ASD symptoms. Sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) is a well-known long-term treatment of urea cycle disorders in children. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effects of NaPB, which is a chemical chaperone as well as histone deacetylase inhibitor on a BTBR T + Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice model of ASD. We found that acute and chronic treatment of NaPB remarkably improved, not only core ASD symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and sociability deficit, but also cognitive impairment in the BTBR mice. NaPB substantially induced histone acetylation in the brain of the BTBR mice. Intriguingly, the therapeutic effects of NaPB on autistic-like behaviors, such as repetitive behaviors, impaired sociability, and cognitive deficit also showed in the valproic acid (VPA)-induced mouse model of autism. In addition, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure was significantly attenuated by NaPB treatment in C57BL/6J and BTBR mice. These findings suggest that NaPB may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with ASD."
