    "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is endemic in many different countries. CHIKV outbreaks are emerging in new areas and re-emerging in previously exposed geographical regions, thus making it a significant public health concern. CHIKV infections are often clinically inapparent, especially in children, which poses a challenge to testing and evaluating any vaccine. During CHIKV infection, CHIKV-specific antibodies are produced, and some of these antibodies can neutralize viruses released from infected cells before they can enter uninfected cells. In this study, we evaluated IgG binding and neutralizing antibody responses in paired serum samples from CHIKV-infected children and those with other febrile illness, using a recombinant truncated E2 protein and whole CHIKV particles as test antigens. Antibody detection using the truncated E2 protein showed a significant overlap between CHIKV-infected subjects and those with other febrile illnesses. This overlap was greater when binding antibody titers were determined using fixed CHIKV particles as the test antigen. Acute- and convalescent-phase sera collected from children after CHIKV infection showed significant differences in their neutralizing capacity. The neutralizing and binding antibody response showed a significant positive correlation. We detected IgG antibodies in most cases during the acute phase of infection. This was observed at two different geographical locations, one of which is not considered highly endemic. Conventional wisdom would suggest this to be a marker of re-infection (secondary infection). However, dissenting opinions have been voiced in other viral diseases (such as Ebola) where studies have detected IgG in acute illness. In the absence of any significant body of work documenting secondary CHIKV infections, we believe further work is needed to understand the early IgG response that we observed."
