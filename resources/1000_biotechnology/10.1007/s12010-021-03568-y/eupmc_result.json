    "β-Glucosidases primarily catalyze removal of terminal glucosyl residues from a variety of glucoconjugates and also perform transglycosylation and reverse hydrolysis. These catalytic properties can be readily exploited for degradation of lignocellulosic biomass as well as for pharmaceutical, food and flavor industries. β-Glucosidases have been either isolated in the native form from the producer organism or recombinantly expressed and gaged for their biochemical properties and substrate specificities. Although almond and Aspergillus niger have been instantly recognizable sources of β-glucosidases utilized for various applications, an intricate pool of novel β-glucosidases from different sources can provide their potent replacements. Moreover, one can envisage the better efficacy of these novel candidates in biofuel and biorefinery industries facilitating efficient degradation of biomass. This article reviews properties of the novel β-glucosidases such as glucose tolerance and activation, substrate specificity, and thermostability which can be useful for their applications in lignocellulose degradation, food industry, and pharmaceutical industry in comparison with the β-glucosidases from the conventional sources. Such β-glucosidases have potential for encouraging white biotechnology."
