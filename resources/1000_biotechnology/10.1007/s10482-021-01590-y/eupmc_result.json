    "The cell of a rod-shaped bacterium is composed of a cylinder and two hemispherical poles. In recent decades, the molecular mechanism of morphogenesis in rod-shaped bacteria has received extensive research. However, most works have focused on the morphogenesis of cylinders, and the morphogenesis of the hemispherical poles remains unclear. In the past, the pole of bacterial cell wall was considered as a rigid hemispherical structure. However, our work indicated that the pole in the isolated sacculi from Bacillus subtilis was a flat structure instead of a hemisphere form. Further works showed that internal pressure was responsible for shaping the hemispherical poles, indicating an elastic nature of the cell wall in poles. In addition, we found that the internal pressure was able to transform septa into hemispherical shape which is similar to normal poles. Based on our work, we proposed a model for the internal pressure-induced formation of hemispherical poles in B. subtilis, and this work may provide new clues into basic knowledge of the morphogenesis of rod-shaped bacteria."
