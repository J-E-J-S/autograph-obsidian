    "One of the most important challenges facing tissue engineering researches is the scaffold design with optimum physical and mechanical properties for growth and proliferation of cells, and tissue formation. The aim of this study was to produce a novel nanocomposite containing β-tricalcium phosphate and layered double hydroxide (β-TCP-LDH) and analyzing the capacity of its osteogenic activity in vitro. In this paper, β-tricalcium phosphate and layered double hydroxide powders were synthesized by co-precipitation processes. Then, the porous nanocomposite granules were prepared by the polyurethane sponge replication method. In this study, four kinds of β-TCP granules containing LDHs nanoparticles (ranging from 0.1 to 10 wt%) have been prepared. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses were selected to study the phase structure, morphology, and phase distribution, respectively. Physicochemical characterizations demonstrated that the granules were synthesized successfully. Interconnected macro pores ranging over 200-500 μm were observed for all kinds of granules. SEM micrographs showed that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were attached to the surfaces of the granules and proliferated in good shape. The results warranted that the synthesized granules exhibited good biocompatibility and mineralization. Based on the results of compressive strength and porosity tests, the most suitable type of granule is β-TCP/LDH 10 wt% with 77% porosity and compressive modulus of 231.4 MPa, which can be utilized in bone tissue engineering. To our knowledge, layered double hydroxides have not previously been incorporated into tricalcium phosphate granules for bone grafting. Also, this study is the first report on the effects of LDH on the mechanical properties and porosity of β-TCP granules. Our results demonstrated that β-TCP/LDH nanocomposite granule has a great potential for bone defects regeneration and tissue engineering applications."
