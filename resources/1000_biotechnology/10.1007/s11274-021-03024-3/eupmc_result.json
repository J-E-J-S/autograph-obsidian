    "Industrialisation, directly or indirectly, exposes humans to various xenobiotics. The increased magnitude of chemical pesticides and toxic heavy metals in the environment, as well as their intrusion into the food chain, seriously threatens human health. Therefore, the surveillance of xenobiotics is crucial for social safety and security. Online investigation by traditional methods is not sufficient for the detection and identification of such compounds because of the high costs and their complexity. Advancement in the field of genetic engineering provides a potential opportunity to use genetically modified microorganisms. In this regard, whole-cell-based microbial biosensors (WCBMB) represent an essential tool that couples genetically engineered organisms with an operator/promoter derived from a heavy metal-resistant operon combined with a regulatory protein in the gene circuit. The plasmid controls the expression of the reporter gene, such as gfp, luc, lux and lacZ, to an inducible gene promoter and has been widely applied to assay toxicity and bioavailability. This review summarises the recent trends in the development and application of microbial biosensors and the use of mobile genes for biomedical and environmental safety concerns."
