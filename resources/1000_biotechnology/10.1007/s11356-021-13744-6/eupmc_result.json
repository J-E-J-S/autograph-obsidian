    "Microbial community analysis of crude oil containing sludge collected from Duliajan oil field, Assam, India, showed the predominance of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria such as Pseudomonas (20.1%), Pseudoxanthomonas (15.8%), Brevundimonas (1.6%), and Bacillus (0.8%) alongwith anaerobic, fermentative, nitrogen-fixing, nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing, syntrophic bacteria, and methanogenic archaea. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis indicated gene collection for potential hydrocarbon degradation, lipid, nitrogen, sulfur, and methane metabolism. The culturable microbial community was predominated by Pseudomonas and Bacillus with the metabolic potential for utilizing diverse hydrocarbons, crude oil, and actual petroleum sludge as sole carbon source during growth and tolerating various environmental stresses prevailing in such contaminated sites. More than 90% of the isolated strains could produce biosurfactant and exhibit catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity. Nearly 30% of the isolates showed alkane hydroxylase activity with the maximum specific activity of 0.54 Î¼mol min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>. The study provided better insights into the microbial diversity and functional potential within the crude oil containing sludge which could be exploited for in situ bioremediation of contaminated sites."
