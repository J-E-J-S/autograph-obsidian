    "Lung cancer is the most aggressive as well as deadly form of cancer and most of the lung cancer cases are involved in direct smoking or passive smoking. Oxidative stress and pulmonary inflammation regulated by some transcription factors like Nrf2, NF-κB etc. play important roles in lung cancer. Various combinations of therapies are currently attributed to lung cancer treatment. A plethora of evidence supports that the consumption of plant-derived foods can prevent chronic diseases like cancer. Leaves of olive (Olea europaea L.) are rich in phenolic compounds which are having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property. Also, bromelain from pineapple juice and from pineapple stem is a potent anti-inflammatory agent. We took a pragmatic approach to prevent carcinogenesis by supplementing the combination of these two extracts. In this study, we have tried to evaluate the amelioration of various hallmarks associated with benzo(a)pyrene-induced lung carcinogenesis upon the combinatorial treatment of ethanolic olive leaf extract (EOLE) and bromelain. We have studied the role of EOLE in amelioration of BaP-induced oxidative stress in the lung. As several reports of anticancer activity of bromelain are available, we have combined EOLE with bromelain to study their protective role against BaP-mediated lung damage. Changes in DNA integrity, LPO level in lung after EOLE-treated animal were examined. Then, we have evaluated the synergistic role of EOLE and bromelain. We have found that EOLE in combination with bromelain was able to increase the translocation of Nrf2 from cytoplasm to nucleus and decrease the translocation of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. Combination of treatment also reduced the expression of TNFα, IL-6, and some matrix metalloproteinases in lung tissue. Our findings suggest that EOLE and bromelain can synergistically reduce the BaP-induced lung carcinogenesis associated with inflammation and oxidative stress via regulating the expression of various inflammatory markers and also modulating the activity of pulmonary antioxidant armories."
