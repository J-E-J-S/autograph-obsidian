    "Vibrio natriegens is emerging as a promising host for biotechnology which is basically due to the remarkable intrinsic properties such as the exceptionally high growth and substrate consumption rates. The facultatively anaerobic marine bacterium possesses a versatile metabolism, is able to utilize a variety of substrates as carbon and energy sources and is easy to handle in the lab. These features initiated the rapid development of genetic tools and resulted in extensive engineering of production strains in the past years. Although recent examples illustrate the potential of V. natriegens for biotechnology, a comprehensive understanding of the metabolism and its regulation is still lacking but essential to exploit the full potential of this bacterium. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the physiological traits and the genomic organization, provide an overview of the available genetic engineering tools and recent advances in metabolic engineering of V. natriegens. Finally, we discuss the obstacles which have to be overcome in order to establish V. natriegens as industrial production host."
