    "Bacillus coagulans has been widely studied for its probiotic properties. Therefore, identifying a strain that can be used as an adjunct starter culture for yogurt production would have commercial value. In this study, 30 B. coagulans strains were isolated from vegetable samples from 11 provinces or autonomous regions in China, and their pan-genomic and phylogenetic characteristics were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis categorized 30 strains into 4 different subphylotypes, including subtype I (11 isolates), subtype II (7 isolates), subtype III (11 isolates), and subtype IV (1 isolate). Four B. coagulans strains (B. coagulans-70, B. coagulans-78, B. coagulans-79, and B. coagulans-100) were randomly selected from each subphylotype of the phylogenetic tree as adjunct starter cultures. Compared with the other tested strains, B. coagulans-70 showed the highest count in yogurt at the end of the manufacturing period. Comparative genome analysis indicated that the different bacterial levels of B. coagulans strains in yogurt may be associated with the abundance of genes related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism (e.g., sucrose utilization). Finally, differences in texture and volatile flavor compound profiles were observed between the yogurt samples. Compared with the other groups, the addition of B. coagulans-70 exerted a positive effect on the appearance and texture of yogurt products. Volatile analysis showed increased quantities of 2-heptanone, 2-nonanone, amyl alcohol, and 2-hydroxy-3-pentanone in the B. coagulans-70 group compared with control yogurts. These results above combined with the results of a sensory evaluation indicated that B. coagulans-70 is the most suitable strain for further use in functional dairy product development."
