    "Biomimetic matrices offer a great advantage to understand several biological processes including regeneration. The study involves the development of a hybrid biomimetic scaffold and the uniqueness lies in the use of mucin, as a constituent protein. Through this study, the role of the protein in bone regeneration is deciphered through its development as a 3D model. As a first step towards understanding the protein, the interactions of mucin and collagen are determined by in silico studies considering that collagen is the most abundant protein in the bone microenvironment. Both proteins are reported to be involved in bone biology though the exact role of mucin is a topic of investigation. The in silico studies of collagen-mucin suggest to have a proper affinity toward each other, forming a strong basis for 3D scaffold development. The developed 3D scaffold is a double network system comprising of mucin and collagen and vinyl end functionalized polyethylene glycol. In situ deposition of mineral crystals has been performed enzymatically. Biological evaluation of these mineral deposited scaffolds is done in terms of their bone regeneration potential and a comparison of the two systems with and without mineral deposition is presented."
