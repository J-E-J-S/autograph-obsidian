    "<h4>Objective</h4>This work designs an in vitro multi-enzyme system to produce CDP-choline form D-ribose, and develop an optimization procedure for one-pot multi-enzyme catalytic system.<h4>Results</h4>The entire process integrated ten enzymes, and an efficient acetate kinase/acetyl phosphate-based ATP regeneration module was applied. Then some optimizations to this system were made including selecting optimum enzyme building blocks and improving expression parameters. The process improved the final yield of CDP-choline form 0.2g/L to 6g/L (CDP-choline titer 12.2 mM).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This new one pot CDP-choline producing system has a potential for industrial use, and the optimization procedure shed light on improving other one pot multi-enzyme system for industrial production of energy rich compounds.
