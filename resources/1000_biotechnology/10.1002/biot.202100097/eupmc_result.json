    "β-farnesene is a sesquiterpenoid with various industrial applications which is now commercially produced by a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain obtained by random mutagenesis and genetic engineering. We rationally designed a genetically defined Yarrowia lipolytica through recovery of L-leucine biosynthetic route, gene dosage optimization of β-farnesene synthase and disruption of the competition pathway. The resulting β-farnesene titer was improved from 8 mg/L to 345 mg/L. Finally, the strategy for decreasing the lipid accumulation by individually and iteratively knocking out four acyltransferases encoding genes was adopted. The result displayed that β-farnesene titer in the engineered strain CIBT6304 in which acyltransferases (DGA1 and DGA2) were deleted increased by 45% and reached 539 mg/L (88 mg/g DCW). Using fed-batch fermentation, CIBT6304 could produce the highest β-farnesene titer (22.8 g/L) among the genetically defined strains. This study will provide the foundation of engineering Y. lipolytica to produce other terpenoids more cost-efficiently. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
