    "The negative effects of salinity on plant growth and physiology are well-established, which is one of the major threats to food security in semi-arid and arid regions of the world. The current research focuses on biosynthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) from a bacterial strain NST2, which was genetically identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae based on taxonomic identity of 16S rRNA gene. The strain was selected for bioprospecting of CuNPs owing to its Cu tolerance potential. The biologically-synthesized CuNPs were confirmed in culture by using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy. The material characteristics of green CuNPs were further investigated by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, where crystallite size was ranged from 22.44 nm to 44.26 nm and particles were stabilized by various functional groups, such as carbonyl and amine groups. When 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of green CuNPs were mixed in saline soil in a pot experiment, the maize plants showed increased root and shoot length (43.52% and 44.06%, respectively), fresh weight (46.05% and 51.82%, respectively) and dry weight (47.69% and 30.63%, respectively) in comparison to control maize plants without CuNPs application. Moreover, green CuNPs at their highest treatment level (100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of soil) counteracted the lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in maize plants by promoting the activities of antioxidants and demoting the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species and ionic contents of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. Conclusively, biogenic CuNPs is an emerging and promising technique, which could replace traditional methods of salinity management in agricultural soils."
