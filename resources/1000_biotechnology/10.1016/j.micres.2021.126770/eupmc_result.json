    "Trichoderma species are well known for producing various secondary metabolites in response to different fungal pathogens. This paper reports the effects of the metabolites produced during one-day cultivation of Trichoderma harzianum on the growth and development of the popular pathogen Fusarium culmorum. Inhibition of the growth of the pathogen and production of secondary metabolites including zearalenone was observed on Petri dishes. The presence of proteins such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4, glutathione-independent glyoxalase HSP31, and putative peroxiredoxin pmp20 in the extract-treated culture indicated oxidative stress, which was confirmed by the presence of a higher amount of catalase and dismutase in the later hours of the culture. A larger amount of enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase resulted in faster growth, and the overexpression of stress protein and Woronin body major protein indicated the activation of defense mechanisms. In addition, a cardinal reduction in major mycotoxin production was noted."
