    "Protecting crops from infestations is critical to ensuring stable, safe food production. However, many consumers are concerned about the use of pesticides and agricultural biotechnology (agri-biotech) applications. A lack of consumer acceptance can prevent potentially beneficial applications from being utilized. This study examines consumer acceptance of pesticide use in conventional and organic agriculture and agri-biotech applications as crop-protection measures. An online between-subject experiment was conducted with participants from the German-speaking part of Switzerland (N = 643). The results revealed that consumers were most willing to accept gene transfers as a protection measure, provided the gene came from a wild variety of the same species as the cultivated plant. Both chemophobia and the importance of naturalness in food influence consumer acceptance of pesticide use and agri-biotech applications. Addressing chemophobia and informing consumers about the role of technologies in pest-management and crop-protection could lead them to trust and accept related agricultural policies."
