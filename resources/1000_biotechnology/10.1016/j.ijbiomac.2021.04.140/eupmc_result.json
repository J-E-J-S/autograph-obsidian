    "Consumption of marine alga-based polysaccharides as additional functional foods can endow with health benefits by diminishing the risk of chronic diseases. A polygalacto-fucopyranose characterized as [→1)-2, 4-SO<sub>3</sub>-α-Fucp-(3 → 1)-{2-SO<sub>3</sub>-α-Fucp-(3→}] with [(4 → 1)-6-OAc-β-Galp-(4→] side chain isolated from marine alga Sargassum wightii exhibited potential antihypertensive activity. Upon treatment with studied polygalactofucan (50 mg/kg BW), serum hypertension biomarkers troponin-T (1.3 pg/mL), troponin-I (1.2 μg/dL) and angiotensin-II converting enzyme (0.18 pg/mL) were significantly recovered in hypertensive rats compared to disease control. Serum cardiovascular risk indices of diseased rats were significantly decreased (< 10%, p < 0.05) after administration of the studied galactofucan (50 mg/kg BW) related to hypertension group (> 17%), and were comparable with standard antihypertensive agent telmisartan (8.3-10.2% at 2 mg/kg BW). The studied compound was safe for consumption as obvious from the high LD<sub>50</sub> value (>5 g/kg), and could be developed as a prospective functional food ingredient attenuating the pathophysiological attributes causing hypertension-related conditions."
