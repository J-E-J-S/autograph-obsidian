    "Camptothecin (CPT), a well-known monoterpenoid indole alkaloid with broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity, is produced from plants and endophytes. In view of the limitations of plants as sources of camptothecin in productivity and efficiency, endophytes serve as the fast growth, high cost-effectiveness, good reproducibility, and feasible genetic manipulation, so they have the potential to meet the huge market demand of the pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we summarized the isolation, identification and fermentation of CPT-producing endophytes, as well as the biosynthesis, extraction and detection of camptothecin from endophytes. Among them, we put emphasis on increasing the production of camptothecin in endophytes through different strategies such as changing the proportion of carbon, nitrogen and phosphate source, adding the precursors, elicitors or adsorbent resin, utilizing co-culture fermentation or fermenter culture. However, cell subculture and metabolic reprogramming affect the expression of camptothecin biosynthetic genes in CPT-producing endophytes, which poses a challenge to the industrial production of camptothecin. Therefore, it will be useful to gain insights through the review of these researches and provide alternative approaches to develop economical, eco-friendly and reliable natural products."
