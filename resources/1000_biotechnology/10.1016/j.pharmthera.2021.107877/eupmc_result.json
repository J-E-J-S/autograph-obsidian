    "Iron is an essential element for the mammalian body however, its homeostasis must be regulated accurately for appropriate physiological functioning. Alterations in physiological iron levels can lead to moderate to severe iron disorders like chronic and acute iron deficiency (anemia) or iron overload. Hepcidin plays an important role in regulating homeostasis between circulating iron and stored iron in the cells as well as the absorption of dietary iron in the intestine. Inflammatory disorders restrict iron absorption from food due to increased circulating levels of hepcidin. Increased production of hepcidin causes ubiquitination of ferroportin (FPN) leading to its degradation, thereby retaining iron in the spleen, duodenal enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes. Hepcidin inhibitors and antagonists play a consequential role to ameliorate inflammation-associated anemia. Many natural and synthesized compounds, able to reduce hepcidin expression during inflammation have been identified in recent years. Few of which are currently at various phases of clinical trial. This article comprises a comprehensive review of therapeutic approaches for the efficient treatment of anemia associated with inflammation. Many strategies have been developed targeting the hepcidin-FPN axis to rectify iron disorders. Hepcidin modulation with siRNAs, antibodies, chemical compounds, and plant extracts provides new insights for developing advanced therapeutics for iron-related disorders. Hepcidin antagonist's treatment has a high potential to improve iron status in patients with iron disorders, but their clinical success needs further recognition along with the identification and application of new therapeutic approaches."
