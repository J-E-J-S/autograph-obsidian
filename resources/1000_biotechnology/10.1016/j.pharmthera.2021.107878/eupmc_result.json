    "Recent years have seen a renewed interest on the possible therapeutic exploitations of specific cannabinoids derived from the Cannabis sativa plant. Thus far, the most studied non-psychotomimetic cannabinoid is cannabidiol (CBD), which has shown promising therapeutic potential for relieving a variety of neurological diseases. However, also its propyl analogue, cannabidivarin (CBDV), has recently gained much attention as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of disabling neurological conditions. This review aims at providing a comprehensive and updated overview of the available animal and human data, which have investigated the possible therapeutic potential of CBDV for the management of epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder."
