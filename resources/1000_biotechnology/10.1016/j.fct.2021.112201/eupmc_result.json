    "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is one of the most potent mycotoxin contaminating several foods and feeds. It suppresses immunity and consequently increases mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, embryonic toxicity and increasing morbidity and mortality. Continuous exposure of AFB1 causes liver damage and thus increases the prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatic cancer. This article was planned to provide understanding of AFB1 toxicity and provides future directions for fabrication of cost effective and user-friendly nanomaterials based analytical devices. In the present article various conventional (chromatographic & spectroscopic), modern (PCR & immunoassays) and nanomaterials based biosensing techniques (electrochemical, optical, piezoelectrical and microfluidic) are discussed alongwith their merits and demerits. Nanomaterials based amperometric biosensors are found to be more stable, selective and cost-effective analytical devices in comparison to other biosensors. But many unresolved issues about their stability, toxicity and metabolic fate needs further studies. In-depth studies are needed for development of advanced nanomaterials integrated biosensors for specific, sensitive and fast monitoring of AFB1 toxicity in foods. Integration of biosensing system with micro array technology for simultaneous and automated detection of multiple AFs in real samples is also needed. Concerted efforts are also required to reduce their possible hazardous consequences of nanomaterials based biosensors."
