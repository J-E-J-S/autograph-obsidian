    "Glucans are the most abundant natural polysaccharides across the living kingdom with tremendous biological activities. Now a days, α-D-glucans are gaining importance as a prebiotics, nutraceuticals, immunostimulants, antiproliferative agents and biodegradable polymers in pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors. A wide variety of bioresources including bacteria, fungi, lichens, algae, plants and animals produce α-D-glucans either as an exopolysaccharide (EPS) or a cell wall component or an energy storage polymer. The α-D-glucans exhibit great structural and functional diversity as the type of linkage and percentage of branching dictate the functional properties of glucans. Among the different linkages, bioactivities are greatly confined to the α-D-(1 → 3) linkages whereas starch and other polymers consisting of α-D-(1 → 4) (1 → 6) linkages are specific for food and pharmaceutical applications. However, the bioactivities of the α-D-(1 → 3) glucans in native form is limited mainly due to their hydrophobic nature. Hence several derivatization techniques have been developed to improve the bioavailability as well as bioactive features such as antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antitumor properties. Though, several reports have presented about α-D-glucans, still there is an ambiguity in terms of their structure among different natural sources and moreover no comprehensive information was available on their derivatization techniques and application potential. Therefore, the present review summarizes distinct description on diverse sources, type of linkages, derivatization techniques as well as the application potential of the native and modified α-D-glucans."
