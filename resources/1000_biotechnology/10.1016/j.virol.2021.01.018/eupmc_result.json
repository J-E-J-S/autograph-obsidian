    "Wheat yellow mosaic virus (family Potyviridae; genus Bymovirus), is an important soil-borne virus that causes serious economic losses in wheat. In this study, we constructed infectious cDNA clones of WYMV genomic RNAs under the control of 35S or SP6 promoter for versatile usage (agroinfiltration or in vitro RNA transcription). Our results showed that an Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation system enabled WYMV to infect the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana without causing WYMV systemic infection. However, in vitro transcripts from infectious cDNA clones using the SP6 promoter promoted WYMV systemic infection of wheat plants, which was then developed for further assays. The optimal temperature for virus multiplication and systemic infection of wheat was 8 °C. Additionally, a synergistic effect between WYMV and Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV) was also detected. This is the first report of the construction of a Chinese isolate of WYMV and should facilitate the investigation of viral pathogenesis."
