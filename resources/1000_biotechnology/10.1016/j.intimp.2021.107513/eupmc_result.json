    "The objective of the current study was to demonstrate the immunostimulatory effects of a polysaccharide isolated from Chrysanthemum zawadskii Herbich var. latilobum leaves (CP) and evaluate its potential as a vaccine adjuvant. Results showed that CP induced maturation of the dendritic cells (DCs). In addition, CP-treated DCs activated naïve T cells to polarized CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and substantially induced the production of IFN-γ and IL-2 in vitro. Furthermore, CP initiated the maturation of DCs via the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Interestingly, systemic administration of CP-treated DCs pulsed with ovalbumin (OVA) peptides significantly enhanced the immune response in vivo, which included the generation of antigen (OVA)-specific polyfunctional T cells, increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, induction of Th1-mediated humoral immunity, and suppression of tumor growth. Taken together, our study highlighted the immunoregulatory activity of CP as well as its potential as a candidate vaccine adjuvant."
