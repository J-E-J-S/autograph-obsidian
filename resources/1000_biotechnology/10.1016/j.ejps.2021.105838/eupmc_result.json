    "The taxanes are commonly used in the treatment of many types of cancer. The disadvantages of using taxanes in therapy are their low solubility in water, the toxicity or relatively poor pharmacokinetics of existing formulations. UsingÂ liposomes as carriers would help in overcoming these problems, however, their use is limited by the low incorporation efficiency of taxane molecules within bilayer and by subsequent drug crystallization. Most of published taxanes liposomal formulations use natural soy phosphatidylcholine (PC) as main liposomes lipid. This allows a relatively good drug retention during the liposomes storage, but on the other hand, the use of liposomes with more liquid bilayer facilitates fast drug release after its intravenous administration. In order to decrease the drug release from liposomes in circulation, we used pegylated HSPC (hydrogenated soy PC) liposomes containing a novel synthetic 3-n-pentadecylphenol derivative - KW101, that showed a remarkably stabilizing action for the docetaxel (DTX) dopped HSPC liposomes over 30 days, expressed by the inhibition of DTX crystallization. The resulting liposomes with DTX showed similar cytotoxicity on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and higher toxicity in drug-resistant NCI/ADR-RES cell line in comparison with the free DTX. Moreover, this formulation has good pharmacokinetics in mice, in comparison to control pegylated DTX formulation composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (ePC). This novel liposomal formulation of docetaxel consisting of HSPC with the stabilizing compound KW101, appears to be a promising carrier for DTX cancer therapy."
