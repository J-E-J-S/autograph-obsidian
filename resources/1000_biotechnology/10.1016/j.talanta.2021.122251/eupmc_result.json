    "A detailed molecular flavor profile was necessary to understand the low acceptance of soy drink by Western consumers. Accordingly, key odor-active compounds were detected by means of aroma dilution analyses coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry after application of suitable solvent-free volatile extraction techniques. Four quantification methods (standard addition, external calibration, internal standard, and stable isotope dilution assay) were developed and validated to measure the concentrations after direct immersion-stir bar sorptive extraction. The quantitative methods provided correctness between 97% and 111% and precision ranging from 78% to 99% for the 21 key odorants. Considering the advantages to be efficient, easy to perform and cheap, internal standard method was further applied to four commercially available soy drinks in Germany. Correlated to a sensory acceptance test (n = 52) contents of 1-octen-3-one, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol were suggested to be linked to the aversion of Western consumers to soy drink."
