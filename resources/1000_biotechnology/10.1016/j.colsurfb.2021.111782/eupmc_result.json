    "Hydrogel adhesives with high tissue adhesion, biodegradability and biocompatibility are benefit for promoting surgical procedures and minimizing the pain and post-surgical complications of patients. In this paper, an injectable mussel inspired double cross-linked hydrogel adhesive composed of thiolated mussel inspired chitosan (CSDS) and tetra-succinimidyl carbonate polyethylene glycol (PEG-4S) was designed and developed. CSDS was synthesized with thiol and catechol groups inspired by the synergistic effect of mussel foot proteins (mfps). The double cross-linked hydrogel was first formed by the addition of sodium periodate (or Fe<sup>3+</sup>) and then double cross-linked with PEG-4S. The results showed that the mechanical and adhesion properties of the double cross-linked hydrogels were significantly improved by the synergistic effects of the functional groups. And the prepared hydrogels showed good cytocompatibility which evaluated by determining the viability of L929 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, the biodegradability and biocompatibility in vivo were further confirmed by subcutaneous implantation in mice model, and the histological analysis results identified that the prepared hydrogels were in vivo biocompatible. This work presents an injectable mussel inspired double cross-linked hydrogels that can use as a potential hydrogel adhesive for biomedical application."
