    "The perennial ornamental peanut Arachis glabrata represents one of the most adaptable wild Arachis species. This study used PacBio combined with BGISEQ-500 RNA-seq technology to study the transcriptome and gene expression dynamics of A. glabrata. Of the total 109,747 unique transcripts obtained, >90,566 transcripts showed significant homology to known proteins and contained the complete coding sequence (CDS). RNA-seq revealed that 1229, 1039, 1671, 3923, 1521 and 1799 transcripts expressed specifically in the root, stem, leaf, flower, peg and pod, respectively. We also identified thousands of differentially expressed transcripts in response to drought, salt, cold and leaf spot disease. Furthermore, we identified 30 polyphenol oxidase encoding genes associated with the quality of forage, making A. glabrata suitable as a forage crop. Our findings presented the first transcriptome study of A. glabrata which will facilitate genetic and genomics studies and lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the A. glabrata genome."
