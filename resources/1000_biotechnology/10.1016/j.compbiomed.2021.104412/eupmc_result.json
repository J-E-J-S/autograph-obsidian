    "Campylobacter jejuni, gram-negative bacteria, is an infectious agent of foodborne disease-causing bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher syndrome in humans. Campylobacter spp. with multidrug resistance to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, and erythromycin are reported. Hence, an effective vaccine candidate would provide long-term immunity against C. jejuni infections. Thus, we used a subtractive proteomics pipeline to prioritize essential proteins, which impart a critical role in virulence, replication and survival. Five proteins, i.e. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein, UPF0324 membrane protein Cj0999c, DNA translocase FtsK, 50S ribosomal protein L22, and 50S ribosomal protein L1 were identified as virulent proteins and selected for vaccine designing. We reported that the multi-epitopes subunit vaccine based on CTL, HTL and B-cell epitopes combination possess strong antigenic properties and associates no allergenic reaction. Further investigation revealed that the vaccine interacts with the immune receptor (TLR-4) and triggered the release of primary and secondary immune factors. Moreover, the CAI and GC contents obtained through codon optimization were reported to be 0.93 and 53% that confirmed a high expression in the selected vector. The vaccine designed in this study needs further scientific consensus and will aid in managing C. jejuni infections."
