    "Pond-ditch circulation system (PDCS) is a promising remediation strategy for rural wastewater treatment. Aquatic plants play nonnegligible roles in the nutrient removal of the PDCS. However, mechanisms of root exudates regulating nutrient removal in PDCSs remained unclear. In our study, the PDCS achieved higher total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) removal rates (72.7-97.4%) compared to the static system. Protein contents in root exudates of the PDCS ranged from 0.041 to 1.332 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, showing negative associations with Simpson index. Lactic acid and tartaric acid in the PDCS varied from 0.045 to 0.380 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.024 to 5.446 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, which were tightly linked with TN, TP, and TP removal rates and most sediment properties, especially sediment total nitrogen (STN) and total organic carbon (TOC), and sediment inorganic phosphorus (SIP). Moreover, the top 3 relative dominant genus were Bacillus (0.11%-17.90%), Geobacter (0.35%-12.04%), and Clostridium sensu stricto 1 (0.14%-12.05%), which might be the predominant groups in nutrient removal of PDCSs. RDA results indicated that lactic acid, protein, and amino acids were positively correlated with Geobacter; while Bacillus was significantly affected by water content. Path analysis further demonstrated that the indirect effect of secretion from plant roots on nutrient removal rates was mainly through modulating bacteria diversity and relative abundance. Taken together, root exudates, especially protein, amino acids, and lactic acid, altered rhizosphere microbial relative abundance and diversity, where the impacts were bacterial species-dependent."
