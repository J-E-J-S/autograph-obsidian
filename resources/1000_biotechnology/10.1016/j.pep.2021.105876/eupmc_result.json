    "Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) is a causative agent of high mortality in fish resulting in significant economic loss to the fish industry in many countries. The major capsid protein (MCP) (ORF006) is an important structural component that mediates virus entry into the host cell, therefore it is a good candidate antigen of ISKNV for subunit vaccine development. In this study, MCP of ISKNV was successfully produced in Escherichia coli strain Ril and was purified as the soluble form by refolding recombinant MCP using urea in combination with dialysis process. The refolded recombinant MCP protein had ability of oligomerization to become trimer like native MCP protein. Fish immunized with refolded recombinant MCP showed significantly higher serum antibody titer than fish immunized with insoluble form of the protein (p < 0.05) at 21, 28- and 35-day post-immunization (dpi). Analysis of immune-related genes response in spleen and kidney of fish immunized with refolded recombinant MCP suggested that MHC-I, MHC-II, IL-1β and IL-4 genes were also significantly expressed relative to the group immunized with insoluble protein (p < 0.05) at 14, 21, 28- and 35-day post immunization. The highest serum antibody and immune related genes response were found at 28 day post immunization. Therefore, refolded recombinant MCP should be better than previously reported insoluble form as the candidate subunit vaccine to prevent infection of Nile tilapia from ISKNV."
