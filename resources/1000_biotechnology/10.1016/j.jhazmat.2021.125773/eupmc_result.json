    "The study was designed to simultaneously evaluate the influence of high doses (512-1024 µg/g) the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials on the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge, qualitative and quantitative changes in microbial consortia responsible for the fermentation process, the presence of methanogenic microorganisms, and the fate of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The efficiency of antibiotic degradation during anaerobic treatment was also determined. Metronidazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin exerted the greatest effect on methane fermentation by decreasing its efficiency. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, cefuroxime and sulfamethoxazole were degraded in 100%, whereas ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were least susceptible to degradation. The most extensive changes in the structure of digestate microbiota were observed in sewage sludge exposed to metronidazole, where a decrease in the percentage of bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes led to an increase in the proportions of bacteria of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The results of the analysis examining changes in the concentration of the functional methanogen gene (mcrA) did not reflect the actual efficiency of methane fermentation. In sewage sludge exposed to antimicrobials, a significant increase was noted in the concentrations of β-lactam, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone ARGs and integrase genes, but selective pressure was not specific to the corresponding ARGs."
