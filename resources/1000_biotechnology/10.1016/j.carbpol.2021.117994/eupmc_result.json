    "This research evaluates the elicitors activity and structure characterization of four Chrysanthemum indicum polysaccharides (CIPs) which were isolated from C. indicum, obtained CIP1, CIP2, CIP3, CIP4. Results demonstrated that there was a distinct difference in inducibility and CIP3 was significantly stronger than other CIPs through bioactivity-tests. Taking CIP3 with total carbohydrate content 91.93 % as a representative, its structure was elucidated as a relative molecular weight of 8. 741 × 10<sup>3</sup> g/mol and mainly composed of xylose, galacturonic acid, galactose and glucuronic acid. Through GC, IR and NMR, CIP3 was determined to possess a backbone comprised of T-α-d-GalpA, 1,4-α-d-GlcpA, 1,2-α-d-Xylp, 1,3-α-l-Rhap, 1,2,4-α-l-Rhap and sidechains comprised of 1,3-β-d-Galp, 1,6-α-d-Galp, T-α-Glcp, 1,3-β-d-Glcp, 1,4-α-d-Glcp, 1,3,4-α-d-Manp, T-α-l-Fucp. Further results indicated that CIP3 with active sidechains could significantly increase the expression of defense genes in Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (AM). It is believed that the sidechains of CIP3 were necessary to its elicitor activity via bioactivity tests."
