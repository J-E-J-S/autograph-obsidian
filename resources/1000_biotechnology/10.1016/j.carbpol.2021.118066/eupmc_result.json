    "This study aims to develop a novel intraperitoneal two- or three-layered patch with immunomodulatory property for treatment of hernia, regeneration of abdominal wall and prevention of intraperitoneal adhesions. Polypropylene (PP) mesh, middle layer, was intended to provide mechanical support whereas pullulan (PUL) hydrogel coating layer was designed to prevent intraperitoneal adhesions. Fibroin/chitosan oligosaccharide lactate (F/COS) layer electrospun on one side of pullulan was chosen for immunomodulation and abdominal wall regeneration. Physical and mechanical properties and regenerative capacity of intraperitoneal patches were determined. Immunomodulatory property of electrospun layer and whole patch was studied by determining nitric oxide amount produced by RAW 264.7 macrophages. 25 % (w/v) PUL hydrogel and F/COS with 90:10 (w/w) ratio yielded optimal results. Here, we report that fabricated intraperitoneal patches successfully prevented cell adhesion on one side and increased cell viability and proliferation on other side, along with immunomodulation, in vitro."
