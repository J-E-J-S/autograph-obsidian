    "Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a bioactive peptide of the family of melanocortins, is generated from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). So far, the research on the specific functions of ACTH in the immune system of teleosts is limited. We determined two complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of POMC in ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), termed PaPOMC-A and PaPOMC-B. PaPOMCs transcripts occurred in all examined tissues, and their expression in immune tissues changed following experimental infection with Vibrio anguillarum. PaACTH-B, but not PaACTH-A, suppressed the phagocytosis of monocytes/macrophages (MO/MФ). Two isoforms of PaACTH increased the bactericidal capacity of MO/MФ. PaACTH-A increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, while PaACTH-B decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in MO/MФ. Compared with PaACTH-B treatment, the PaACTH-A treatment improved survival rate and reduced the bacterial load in V. anguillarum-infected ayu through interleukin (IL)-10. Our results indicate that the two PaACTH isoforms exert different effects in the host defense against bacterial infection."
