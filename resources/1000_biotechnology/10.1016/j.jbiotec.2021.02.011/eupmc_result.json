    "The bio-production of theanine is currently of significant interest due to its wide applications in food and healthcare products. Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) has been widely applied in L-theanine synthesis, but L-theanine yields remain prohibitively low for commercial production. In this study, a robust high-throughput screening process for isolating GGT mutants was developed through a combination of error-prone PCR techniques and a colorimetric reaction. The co-expression of PrsA lipoprotein enhances the secretion of GGT, thus GGT could be obtained quickly and easily without crushing cells. Random mutations on ggt genes were introduced by using error-prone PCR kits to build a large mutant library. A colorless compound generated by the reaction between NH<sup>4+</sup> (released from L-theanine synthesis) and OPA was measured quantitatively by UV/visible spectroscopy when mixed with TCA and DMSO. Approximately 30 positive clones with improved color formation on the 96-well plates were identified, and mutants T413P and T463S with more than by 30 % higher transpeptidation activity versus the original GGT were isolated. To improve the operational stability and economical use, mutant GGT was immobilized on a prepared oxidized cellulose nanofiber membrane. The remaining activity of immobilized GGT was 88 % versus 72 % of free enzyme over 15 h. A fed-batch conversion was performed with the immobilized GGT, and over 70 g/L L-theanine could be accumulated within 18 h after feeding twice. Versus other studies, this is one of the best L-theanine synthesis systems using immobilized GGT."
