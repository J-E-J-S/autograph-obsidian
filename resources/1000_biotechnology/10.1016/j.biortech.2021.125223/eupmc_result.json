    "Short rotation plantations of willow genotypes, harvested in vegetative growth phases, were tested as an alternative biomass for methane production. The substrate characteristics, maximal methane yields (K) and highest methane production rates (µmax) were determined. Leaves and stems from diploid Energo (EN) and tetraploid (PP) plants, harvested in June were superior methane sources to woody tissue. This could be related to the lower lignin contents in green willow. Fermentation of pooled biomasses from tetraploid genotypes harvested in June-August was more efficient than methane production from diploid tissues. Microbial community analyses by 16S rRNA genes showed a dominance of the order Clostridiales. In field study, based on Energo plantation, the maximum in green biomass accumulation was in early month 9 of the vegetation period. A theoretical calculation showed similar or better energy potential per unit area for willow than in the case of maize silage. This study encourages the use of green willow biomass as feedstock in biomethanation processes due to its relatively low production costs and uncomplicated agricultural practice."
