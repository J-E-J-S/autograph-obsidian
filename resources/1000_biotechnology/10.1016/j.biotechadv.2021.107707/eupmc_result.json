    "Of the 25 million tons of plastic waste produced every year in Europe, 40% of these are not reused or recycled, thus contributing to environmental pollution, one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Most of these plastics are made of petrochemical-derived polymers which are very difficult to degrade and as a result, a lot of research efforts have been made on more environmentally friendly alternatives. Bio-based monomers, derived from renewable raw materials, constitute a possible solution for the replacement of oil-derived monomers, with furan derivatives that emerged as platform molecules having a great potential for the synthesis of biobased polyesters, polyamides and their copolymers. This review article summarizes the latest developments in biotechnological production of furan compounds that can be used in polymer chemistry as well as in their conversion into polymers. Moreover, the biodegradability of the resulting materials is discussed."
