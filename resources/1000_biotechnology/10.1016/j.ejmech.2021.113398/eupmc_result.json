    "A series of novel benzothiazinone derivatives containing a N-(amino)piperazine moiety, based on the structure of WAP-1902 discovered in our lab, were designed and synthesized as new anti-TB agents. Many of the compounds exhibited excellent in vitro activity against both drug-sensitive MTB strain H37Rv and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates (MIC: < 0.016 μg/mL), and good safety index (CC<sub>50</sub>: >64 μg/mL). Especially compound 1o displayed low hERG cardiac toxicity and acceptable oral pharmacokinetic profiles, indicating its promising potential to be a lead compound for future antitubercular drug discovery."
