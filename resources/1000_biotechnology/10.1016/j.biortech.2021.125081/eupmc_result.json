    "Microalgal treatment of undiluted raw piggery wastewater is challenging due to ammonia toxicity and a deep dark color hampering photosynthesis. To overcome these problems, (1) a microalga (Coelastrella sp.) was isolated from an ammonia-rich environment, (2) the wastewater treatment was divided into two steps: a heterotrophic process followed by a mixotrophic process, and (3) a narrower transparent photobioreactor was employed with higher light intensity in the mixotrophic process. Coelastrella sp. removed 99% of ammonia, 92% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 100% of phosphorus during the 4-day process. Acetate in the wastewater relieved the ammonia stress on microalgae and promoted algal lipid and triacylglycerol productivity. Oxidative stability and low-temperature fluidity of triacylglycerols in lipids were improved by means of an altered fatty acid profile. Aside from the overall microalgal treatment performance, the proposed processing of piggery wastewater yielded a material suitable for possible production of algal biodiesel of better quality."
