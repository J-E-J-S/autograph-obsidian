    "Amyloid-β oligomer is an important biomarker and a potential therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease in its early stage. Here, we combined superhydrophobic carbon fiber paper (CFP) with AuPt alloy nanoparticles to prepare a CFP/AuPt nanocomposite with larger specific surface area and hydrophobic surface. On this basis, we constructed an electrochemical aptasensor based on CFP/AuPt for the ultrasensitive detection of amyloid-β oligomers. The surface-coated AuPt nanoparticles greatly enhanced the electroactive area, and the hydrophobic surface increased the resisting nonspecific adsorption performance of sensor. A combination of these two features significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity of the sensor. This electrochemical aptasensor based on CFP/AuPt displayed a low detection limit of 0.16 pg/mL. This work shows a promising future in clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and provides a possible solution to electrochemical biosensors that are susceptible to interference in biological fluids."
