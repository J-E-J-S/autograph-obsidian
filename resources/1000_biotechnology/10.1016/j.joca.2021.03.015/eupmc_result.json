    "<h4>Objective</h4>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent age-related disorder due to cartilage degradation. Previous studies have identified aberrant chondrocyte homeostasis under extracellular stress as a key pathological mechanism behind cartilage degradation in OA. TDP-43, a DNA/RNA-binding protein has been demonstrated to participate in processing many extracellular stress responses; however, understanding of the role of TDP-43 in OA is limited. This study aims to investigate the role of TDP-43 in chondrocyte homeostasis and cartilage degradation in OA.<h4>Methods</h4>The role of TDP-43 during degradation of cartilage is examined by experimental posttraumatic OA animal models and human cartilage specimens. Cartilage degradation is assessed by histological analysis, qPCR, and Western blot. The molecular mechanisms are investigated in vitro using human primary chondrocytes.<h4>Results</h4>TDP-43 decreases significantly in degenerated cartilage. TDP-43 concentration is positively correlated with IL-1β concentration in synovial fluid derived from OA patients (Pearson r = 0.95, CI (95%) [0.80, 0.99], P < 0.0001). Intra-articular injection of recombinant TDP-43 significantly alleviates cartilage degradation and subchondral bone remodeling in vivo. In vitro mechanistic analyses show that TDP-43 maintains chondrocyte homeostasis under oxidative stress through regulating stress granule dynamics via G3BP1.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study indicates that TDP-43 maintains chondrocyte homeostasis under oxidative stress and alleviates cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis, identifying TDP-43 as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of knee OA."
