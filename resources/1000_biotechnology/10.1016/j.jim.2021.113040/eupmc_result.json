    "Background Quantitative detection of allergens is of great significance for clarifying the cause, treatment, and prevention of allergy disease. Birch pollen is one of the most common inhalational allergens and Bet v1 is the major component allergen of birch allergen. This study aims to develop a stable and sensitive chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for the detection of birch pollen allergic specific IgE (sIgE) based on recombinant Bet v1 (rBet v1) protein. Methods rBet v1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Then rBet v1 was applied to detect sIgE in human serum. The performance of the established CLIA was evaluated and compared with Phadia rBet v1 fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (FEIA) system. Results The developed CLIA for sIgE to rBet v1 detection shows excellent performance. The assay showed a linear range from 0.1 to 100 IU/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.06 IU/mL. A total of 164 samples were evaluated by CLIA and compared with the results of FEIA. The positive, negative, and total coincidence rate was 90.6% (87/96), 91.2% (62/68), and 90.9% (149/164), respectively. The r-value of Spearman's rank correlation analysis was 0.935 (P < 0.001). The use of high levels of bilirubin (50 mg/dL), hemoglobin (400 mg/dL) and lipid (2000 mg/dL) didn't interfere with the results. Conclusions The proposed CLIA exhibits excellent performance for the detection of rBet v1 specific IgE. It can be a reliable tool for the early diagnosis of hypersensitivity."
