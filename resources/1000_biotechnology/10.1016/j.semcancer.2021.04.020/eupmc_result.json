    "The interaction between gut microbes and gastrointestinal (GI) tract carcinogenesis has always attracted researchers' attention to identify therapeutic targets or potential prognostic biomarkers. Various studies have suggested that the microbiota do show inflammation and immune dysregulation, which led to carcinogenesis in GI tract. In this review, we have focused on the role of microbes present in gut, intestine, or faeces in GI tract cancers, including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. Herein, we have discussed the importance of the microbes and their metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for cancer detection, especially in the early stage, and prognostic markers. To maximize the effect of the treatment strategies, an accurate evaluation of the prognosis is imperative for clinicians. There is a vast difference in the microbiota profiles within a population and across the populations depending upon age, diet, lifestyle, genetic makeup, use of antibiotics, and environmental factors. Therefore, the diagnostic efficiency of the microbial markers needs to be further validated. A deeper understanding of the GI cancer and the host microbiota is needed to acquire pivotal information about disease status."
