    "Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptors, serve as pivotal signal transduction molecules in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathway to mediate downstream signalling cascades. In this study, four TIR-domain containing adaptors, MyD88, TRIF, MAL and SARM, were identified in mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi, and they all contain TIR domains, of which MyD88 and SARM had high sequence homology with their vertebrate homologues. The expression analysis at mRNA level indicated that these genes were ubiquitously distributed in different tissues, being high in immune- and mucosa-related tissues such as head-kidney and intestine. The transcripts of these adaptor genes were up-regulated by poly(I:C) and LPS stimulation in isolated head-kidney lymphocytes (HKLs) of mandarin fish. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that all these molecules were localized in cytoplasm, and further investigations showed that the over-expression of MyD88, TRIF and MAL activated the NF-κB, ISRE or type Ι IFN promoters and inhibited SVCV replication, whereas their antiviral effects were significantly impaired when co-transfected with SARM. It was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) that SARM interacts separately with MyD88, TRIF and MAL, and MAL interacts with MyD88. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these adaptors involved in signalling pathways of different TLRs should be of interest for further research."
