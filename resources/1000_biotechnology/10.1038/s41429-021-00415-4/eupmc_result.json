    "TMKS8A (1), a new chlorinated α-lapachone derivative, along with five known related metabolites, A80915 C (2), SF2415B1 (3), chlorinated dihydroquinone 3 (4), SF2415B3 (5), and A80915 C (6), were identified from the culture extract of Streptomyces sp. TMKS8, which was isolated from a sea slug, Paromoionchis tumidus. The structure of 1 was determined by the analysis of NMR and MS spectral data, assisted by NMR chemical shift prediction using DFT-based calculation. The absolute configuration was determined to be R by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Compound 1 displayed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC values ranging from 6.25 to 12.5 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> and cytotoxicity against murine leukemia P388 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> 9.8 μM."
