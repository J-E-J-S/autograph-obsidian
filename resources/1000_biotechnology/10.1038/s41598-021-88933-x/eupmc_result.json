    "Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are antigenically related mosquito-borne flaviviruses. ZIKV is becoming increasingly prevalent in DENV-endemic regions, raising the possibility that pre-existing immunity to one virus could modulate the response to a heterologous virus, although whether this would be beneficial or detrimental is unclear. Here, we analyzed sera from residents of a DENV-endemic region of Thailand to determine the prevalence of DENV-elicited antibodies capable of cross-neutralizing ZIKV. Sixty-one participants who were asymptomatic and unselected for viral serostatus were enrolled. Among them, 52 and 51 were seropositive for IgG antibody against DENV or ZIKV E proteins (ELISA assay), respectively. Notably, 44.23% (23/52) of DENV seropositive participants had serological evidence of multiple exposures to DENV, and these subjects had strikingly higher titers and broader reactivities of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against ZIKV and DENV heterotypes compared with participants with serological evidence of a single DENV infection (25/52, 48.1%). In total, 17 of the 61 participants (27.9%) had NAbs against ZIKV and all four DENV serotypes, and an additional 9 (14.8%) had NAbs against ZIKV and DENV1, 2, and 3. NAbs against DENV2 were the most prevalent (44/61, 72.1%) followed by DENV3 (38/61, 62.3%) and DENV1 (36/61, 59.0%). Of note, anti-ZIKV NAbs were more prevalent than anti-DENV4 NAbs (27/61, 44.3% and 21/61, 34.4%, respectively). Primary ZIKV infection was detected in two participants, confirming that ZIKV co-circulates in this region. Thus, residents of DENV-endemic regions with repeated exposure to DENV have higher titers of NAbs against ZIKV than individuals with only a single DENV exposure."
