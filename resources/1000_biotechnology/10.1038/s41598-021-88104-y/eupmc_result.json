    "To investigate the pathophysiologic characteristics of diabetic complications, we identified differences in plasma metabolites in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with or without diabetic macular edema (DME) and a disease duration > 15 years. An cohort of older T2DM patients with prolonged disease duration was established, and clinical information and biospecimens were collected following the guidelines of the National Biobank of Korea. DME phenotypes were identified by ophthalmologic specialists. For metabolomics studies, propensity matched case and control samples were selected. To discover multi-biomarkers in plasma, non-targeted metabolite profiling and oxylipin profiling in the discovery cohort were validated in an extended cohort. From metabolomic studies, 5 amino acids (asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine, and lysine), 2 organic compounds (citric acid and uric acid) and 4 oxylipins (12-oxoETE, 15-oxoETE, 9-oxoODE, 20-carboxy leukotriene B4) were identified as candidate multi-biomarkers which can guide DME diagnosis among non-DME subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed high diagnostic value of the combined 5 amino acids and 2 organic compounds (AUC = 0.918), and of the 4 combined oxylipins (AUC = 0.957). Our study suggests that multi-biomarkers may be useful for predicting DME in older T2DM patients."
