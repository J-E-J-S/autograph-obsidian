    "Endoglucanase producing bacteria were isolated from Egyptian soils and the most active bacterial strain was identified as Bacillus subtilis strain Fatma/1. Plackett-Burman statistical design was carried out to assess the effect of seven process variables on endoglucanase production. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), yeast extract and peptone were the most significant variables that enhanced the endoglucanase production and thus were selected for further optimization using face-centered central composite design. The highest yield of endoglucanase (32.37 U/mL) was obtained in run no. 9, using 18 g/L CMC, 8 g/L peptone, 7 g/L yeast extract and 0.1 g/L FeSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O. The optimized medium showed about eightfold increase in endoglucanase production compared to the unoptimized medium. The produced crude enzyme was further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, then DEAE-Sepharose CL6B column. The purified enzyme was shown to have a molecular weight of 37 kDa. The enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 8.0, temperature of 50 °C, incubation time of 60 min. The half-life time (T<sub>1/2</sub>) was 139.53 min at 50 °C, while being 82.67 min at 60 °C. Endoglucanase at concentration of 12 U/mL effectively removed 84.61% of biofilm matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with marked reduction in carbohydrate content of the biofilm from 63.4 to 7.9 μg."
