    "Hydrogel serve as bone tissue engineering have lately received great attention for their good biocompatibility and structures similar to natural extracellular matrices. However, a single component polymer hydrogel is generally detrimental to cell adhesion due to the weaker mechanical properties, which limits their application considerably. In an effort to overcome this disadvantage, we adopt an unconventional dual network hydrogels consisting of the polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) covalent network, a thiolated chitosan (TCS) ion crosslinking network and thiolated halloysites (T-HNTs) as reinforcing filler. In addition, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) was loaded into the prepared dual network (DN) hydrogel to improve the bone regeneration function of the DN hydrogel. The resulting PEGDA/TCS/T-HNTs hydrogels showed favourable mechanical property, higher crosslinking density, the lower swelling degree, excellent biocompatibility and cell adhesion ability. The histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the excellent bone regeneration ability for composite hydrogel after implant into rat skull defect. Thus, our results indicated that composite scaffold can be applied as a new bone regeneration biomaterial to be applied as a local drug delivery system with good bone induction performance."
