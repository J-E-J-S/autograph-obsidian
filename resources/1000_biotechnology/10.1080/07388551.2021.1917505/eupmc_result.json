    "<i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i> is an ascomycetous yeast which has shown promising results in cellulosic ethanol and renewable chemicals production. It can survive on a variety of carbon sources under industrially favorable conditions due to its fast growth rate, thermotolerance, and acid tolerance. <i>K. marxianus,</i> is generally regarded as a safe (GRAS) microorganism, is widely recognized as a powerhouse for the production of heterologous proteins and is accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for its pharmaceutical and food applications. Since lignocellulosic hydrolysates are comprised of diverse monomeric sugars, oligosaccharides and potential metabolism inhibiting compounds, this microorganism can play a pivotal role as it can grow on lignocellulosic hydrolysates coping with vegetal cell wall derived inhibitors. Furthermore, advancements in synthetic biology, for example CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats with Cas9)-mediated genome editing, will enable development of an engineered yeast for the production of biochemicals and biopharmaceuticals having a myriad of industrial applications. Genetic engineering companies such as Cargill, Ginkgo Bioworks, DuPont, Global Yeast, Genomatica, and several others are actively working to develop designer yeasts. Given the important traits and properties of <i>K. marxianus</i>, these companies may find it to be a suitable biocatalyst for renewable chemicals and fuel production on the large scale. This paper reviews the recent progress made with <i>K. marxianus</i> biotechnology for sustainable production of ethanol, and other products utilizing lignocellulosic sugars."
