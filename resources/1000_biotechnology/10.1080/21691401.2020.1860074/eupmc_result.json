    "Direct molecular methods such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and propidium monoazide (PMA)-qPCR have been successfully used for quantifying viable microorganisms in the food industry. This study attempted to use qPCR and PMA-qPCR for quantifying <i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</i> spp. <i>bulgaricus</i> sp1.1 physiological states. The qPCR standards of the 16S rRNA gene were employed to calibrate the qPCR assay, which contributed to an amplification efficiency of 98.42%. The number of copies of the 16S rRNA gene was linearly related to cell density, and this linear relationship was used to construct a quantitative curve (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i> =0.9981) with a detection limit of 15.1 colony-forming units mL<sup>-1</sup>·reaction<sup>-1</sup>. qPCR in combination with an optimal PMA concentration (60 μM) helped in discriminating and quantifying the viable cells, without any interference by heat-killed cells. Compared with the conventional methods, the population heterogeneity of viable, culturable, dormant-like and membrane-permeabilized cells were well identified and quantified using qPCR during <i>L</i>. <i>delbrueckii</i> spp. <i>bulgaricus</i> sp1.1 batch culture. Despite the restriction in the enumeration of lysed cells, qPCR-based methods facilitated reliable identification and quantification of bacterial physiological states and provided additional knowledge on the dynamics of <i>L</i>. <i>delbrueckii</i> spp. <i>bulgaricus</i> sp1.1 physiological states."
