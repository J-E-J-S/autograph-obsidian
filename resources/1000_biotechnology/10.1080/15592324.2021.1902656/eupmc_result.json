    "Cues and signals of the environment in nature can be either beneficial or detrimental from the growth and developmental perspectives. Plants, despite their limited spatial mobility, have developed advanced strategies to overcome the various and changing environmental impacts including stresses. <i>In vitro</i> plantlets, tissues and cells are constantly exposed to the influence of their environment that is well controlled. Light has a widely known morphogenetic effect on plants; however, other physical cues and signals are at least as important but were often neglected. In this review, I summarize our knowledge about the role of the mechanical stimuli, like sound, ultrasound, touch, or wounding in <i>in vitro</i> plant cultures. I summarize the molecular, biochemical, physiological, growth, and developmental changes they cause and how these processes are controlled; moreover, how their regulating or stimulating roles are applied in various plant biotechnological applications. Recent studies revealed that mechanical forces can be used for affecting the plant development and growth in plant tissue culture efficiently, and for increasing the efficacy of other plant biotechnological methods, like genetic transformation and secondary metabolite production."
