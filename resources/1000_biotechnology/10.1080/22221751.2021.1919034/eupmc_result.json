    "Upon infection of hepatocyte, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomic DNA in nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus and converted into a covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA to serve as the template for transcription of viral RNAs. Viral DNA in the cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsid is another resource to fuel cccDNA amplification. Apparently, nucleocapsid disassembly, or viral genomic DNA uncoating, is an essential step for cccDNA synthesis from both <i>de novo</i> infection and intracellular amplification pathways, and has a potential to activate DNA sensors and induce an innate immune response in infected hepatocytes. However, where and how the nucleocapsid disassembly occurs is not well understood. The work reported herein showed that the enhanced disassembly of progeny mature nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm supported cccDNA intracellular amplification, but failed to activate the cGAS-STING-mediated innate immune response in hepatocytes. Interestingly, while expression of a cytoplasmic exonuclease TREX1 in human hepatoma cells supporting HBV replication significantly reduced the amounts of cccDNA as well as its precursor, deproteinized relaxed circular (rc) DNA, expression of TREX1 in sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide-expressing human hepatoma cells did not inhibit cccDNA synthesis from <i>de novo</i> HBV infection. The results from this cytoplasmic nuclease protection assay imply that the disassembly of progeny mature nucleocapsids and removal of viral DNA polymerase covalently linked to the 5' end of minus strand of rcDNA take place in the cytoplasm. On the contrary, the disassembly of virion-derived nucleocapsids during <i>de novo</i> infection may occur at a different subcellular compartment and possibly <i>via</i> distinct mechanisms."
