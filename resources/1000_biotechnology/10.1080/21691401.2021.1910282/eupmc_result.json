    "Bone integration on the surface of titanium prosthesis is critical to the success of implant surgery. Good Bone integration at the contact interface is the basis of long-term stability. TiO2 nanotubes have become one of the most commonly used modification techniques for artificial joint prostheses and bone defect implants due to their good biocompatibility, mechanical properties and chemical stability. TiO2 nanotubes can promote F-actin polymerization in bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and osteogenic differentiation. The possibility of F-actin as an upstream part to regulate GCN5 initiation of osteogenesis was discussed. The results of gene loss and functional acquisition assay, immunoblotting assay and fluorescence staining assay showed that TiO2 nanotubes could promote the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts. The intervention of TiO2 nanotubes can make BMSCs form stronger F-actin fibre bundles, which can drive the differentiation process of osteogenesis. Our results showed that F-actin mediated nanotube-induced cell differentiation through promoting the expression of GCN5 and enhancing the function of GCN5 and GCN5 was a key regulator of the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs induced by TiO2 nanotubes as a downstream mediated osteogenesis of F-actin, providing a novel insight into the study of osteogenic differentiation on surface of TiO2 nanotubes."
