    "Direct contact between bone and implant materials is required for dental implants. Titanium is used for the implant material owing to its mechanical and biological properties. The anodisation as the surface treatment was employed to enhance osteogenesis around titanium. Moreover, carbon nanohorn (CNH), a type of nanometer-sized carbon material, was reported to promote the bone formation. Thus, it is expected that if the surface of anodised Ti (AnTi) is modified with CNHs, Ti-bone contact would be enhanced. In this study, the Ti surface was modified with CNHs by electrophoresis and obtained anodised titanium coated with CNHs (CNH/AnTi). <i>In vitro</i>, CNH/AnTi attracted osteoblastic cells more than AnTi, thereby the proliferation of osteoblastic cell was enhanced by CNH/AnTi more than by AnTi. <i>In vivo,</i> at 7 and 28â€‰days after implantation of CNH/AnTi or AnTi into the rat femur, more aggressive bone formation was observed on the surface of CNH/AnTi than on AnTi. More importantly, the area where newly formed bone tissue directly attached to CNH/AnTi was significantly larger than that for AnTi, suggesting that \"contact osteogenesis\" was accelerated on CNH/AnTi during the early post-implantation period. CNH/AnTi would be advantageous especially for the early stages of bone regeneration after surgery."
