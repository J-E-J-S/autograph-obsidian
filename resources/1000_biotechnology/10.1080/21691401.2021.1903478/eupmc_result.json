    "This study reports the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from silver nitrate by leaf extract of a medicinal plant <i>Ziziphus nummularia</i>. The leaf extract acts as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the formation of nanoparticles. The green synthesized AgNPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FITR) spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and evaluated their antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic and genotoxic potential. The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed a characteristic absorption peak at 430 nm due to surface plasma resonance. TEM analysis showed that synthesized AgNPs were spherical and oval with an average size of 25.96 nm. AgNPs showed effective antimicrobial activity (lowest MIC-0.625 µg/mL against <i>Escherichia coli</i>), synergistic antimicrobial activity (lowest ΣFIC 0.09 with chlormaphenicol against <i>Corynebacterium rubrum</i>) and antibiofilm activity. AgNPs showed strong DPPH activity with IC<sub>50</sub> - 520 µg/mL and ABTS activity IC<sub>50</sub> - 55 µg/mL and reducing capacity assessment. <i>In vitro</i> cytotoxic effect was evaluated by MTT assay against HeLa cells, breast cells and fibroblast cells. Genotoxic effect was evaluated by comet assay. AgNPs displayed dose-dependent cytotoxic and genotoxic effect. Our findings indicated that synthesized AgNPs could be considered as multifunctional and have great potential for use in biomedical applications.HighlightsSilver nanoparticles were synthesized using leaf extract of <i>Ziziphus nummularia</i>Characterization was done by various spectral techniquesAntimicrobial efficacy was demonstrated against an array of bacteriaAgNPs exhibited significant cytotoxic effect against HeLa cell lineAgNPs showed cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner."
