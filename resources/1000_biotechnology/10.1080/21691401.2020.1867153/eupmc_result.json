    "Determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in serum or plasma is defined as a sensitive method for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and also in many diseases thought to be related to TSH levels. In this study, a novel simple impedimetric immunosensor based on polyamidoamine dendrimer was developed. Anti TSH antibody was immobilized on the gold electrode by using cysteamine self-assembled monolayer strategy. In constructing the immunosensor, a polyamidoamine dendrimer was used to increase the surface area in which AntÄ±-TSH was immobilized and glutaraldehyde was used as a cross-linker. After each immobilization step, the electrode surface was monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques and optimization studies were performed. The reproducibility, repeatability, linearity and sensitivity of the immunosensor were examined. Also, the interference experiments for glucose, salts and proteins in serum were performed. The limit of detection and limit of quantification values of the proposed immunosensor were 0.026 mIUL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.086 mIUL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively and it was able to detect the amount of TSH within a linear range of 0.1-0.6 mIUL<sup>-1</sup>."
