    "Improving the creativity is crucial to postgraduate training nowadays. The course of Modern Microbial Biotechnology is an optional specialized course for microbiology-related postgraduates. To explore a new teaching mode for improving the creativity of postgraduate students, we reformed the teaching content, the teaching method and the evaluation mode of this course. Through case study teaching, seminar-style classroom and implementation of a new assessment method, the students not only mastered professional knowledge and disciplinary frontiers of modern microbiology technology, but also improved their ability of discovering, analyzing and solving problems. The reformed course teaching mode is effective in fostering postgraduates' creativity."
