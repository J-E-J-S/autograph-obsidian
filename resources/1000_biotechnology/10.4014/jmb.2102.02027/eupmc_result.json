    "<i>Acinetobacter</i> strains are widely present in the environment. Some antimicrobial-resistant strains of this genus have been implicated in infections acquired in hospitals. Genetic similarities have been reported between <i>Acinetobacter</i> strains in nosocomial infections and those isolated from foods. However, the antimicrobial resistance of <i>Acinetobacter</i> strains in foods, such as meat, remains unclear. This study initially aimed to isolate <i>Campylobacter</i> strains; instead, strains of the genus <i>Acinetobacter</i> were isolated from meat products, and their antimicrobial resistance was investigated. In total, 58 <i>Acinetobacter</i> strains were isolated from 381 meat samples. Of these, 32 strains (38.6%) were from beef, 22 (26.5%) from pork, and 4 (4.8%) from duck meat. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that 12 strains were resistant to more than one antimicrobial agent, whereas two strains were multidrug-resistant; both strains were resistant to colistin. Cephalosporin antimicrobials showed high minimal inhibitory concentration against <i>Acinetobacter</i> strains. Resfinder analysis showed that one colistin-resistant strain carried <i>mcr-4.3</i>; this plasmid type was not confirmed, even when analyzed with PlasmidFinder. Analysis of the contig harboring <i>mcr-4.3</i> using BLAST confirmed that this contig was related to <i>mcr-4.3</i> of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. The increase in antimicrobial resistance in food production environments increases the resistance rate of <i>Acinetobacter</i> strains present in meat, inhibits the isolation of <i>Campylobacter</i> strains, and acts as a medium for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Therefore, further investigations are warranted to prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance in food products."
