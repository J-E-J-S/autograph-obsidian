    "<h4>Objectives</h4>This study was aimed at investigating the cytotoxicity and multi-drug resistance (MDR) reversal effect of Glucosamine (GlcN) on resistant BCRP-overexpressing breast cancer MCF-7/MX cells.<h4>Methods</h4>After confirming the overexpression of BCRP, the cytotoxicity and MDR reversing potential of GlcN on MCF-7/MX mitoxantrone-resistant and MCF-7 sensitive breast cancer cells were assessed via MTT assay. The effects of GlcN on mitoxantrone accumulation were analyzed through flow cytometry. Finally, the expression of BCRP and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-related markers following the exposure to GlcN were assessed by real-time RT-PCR.<h4>Key findings</h4>This study showed that glucosamine had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. The respective IC50 values for MCF-7/MX cells following exposure to mitoxantrone (MX) in the presence of GlcN (0, 0.5 and 1 mm) for 72 h were 3.61 ± 0.21, 0.598 ± 0.041 and 0.284 ± 0.016 μm, respectively. Furthermore, GlcN reduced the expression of BCRP mRNA without any significant effect on EMT-related markers in breast cancer cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results proposed that glucosamine as a natural sugar could down regulate the BCRP expression and increased MX cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells."
