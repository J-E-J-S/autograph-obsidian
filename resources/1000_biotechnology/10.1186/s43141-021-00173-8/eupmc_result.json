    "<h4>Background</h4>Trachyspermum ammi is one of the key medicinal plant species with many beneficial properties. Thymol is the most important substance in the essential oil of this plant. Thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with high anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant properties. Thymol in the latest research has a significant impact on slowing the progression of cancer cells in human. In this research, embryos were employed as convenient explants for the fast and effectual regeneration and transformation of T. ammi. To regenerate this plant, Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Gamborg's B5 (B5) media were supplemented with diverse concentrations of plant growth regulators, such as 6-benzyladenine (BA), 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and kinetin (kin). Transgenic Trachyspermum ammi plants were also obtained using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and zygotic embryos explants. Moreover, two Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains (EHA101 and LBA4404) harboring pBI121-TPS2 were utilized for genetic transformation to Trachyspermum ammi.<h4>Results</h4>According to the obtained results, the highest plant-regeneration frequency was obtained with B5 medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BA and 1 mg/l NAA. The integrated gene was also approved using the PCR reaction and the Southern blot method. Results also showed that the EHA101 strain outperformed another strain in inoculation time (30 s) and co-cultivation period (1 day) (transformation efficiency 19.29%). Furthermore, HPLC method demonstrated that the transformed plants contained a higher thymol level than non-transformed plants.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this research, a fast protocol was introduced for the regeneration and transformation of Trachyspermum ammi, using zygotic embryo explants in 25-35 days. Our findings confirmed the increase in the thymol in the aerial part of Trachyspermum ammi. We further presented an efficacious technique for enhancing thymol content in Trachyspermum ammi using Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation system that can be beneficial in genetic transformation and other plant biotechnology techniques."
