    "Oxidative stress (OS) in the foetal and neonatal periods leads to many disorders in newborns and in later life. The nutritional status of pregnant women is considered to be one of the key factors that triggers OS. We investigated the relationship between the concentration of selected mineral elements in the blood of pregnant women and the concentration of 3'nitrotyrosine (3'NT) as a marker of OS in the umbilical cord blood of newborns. The study group consisted of 57 pregnant women and their newborn children. The concentrations of magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in maternal serum (MS) were measured by the flame atomic absorption/emission spectrometry (FAAS/FAES) method. The concentration of 3'NT in umbilical cord serum (UCS) of newborns was determined by the ELISA method. A positive correlation between MS Fe and UCS 3'NT in male newborns was shown (rho = 0.392, <i>p</i> = 0.053). Significantly higher UCS 3'NT was demonstrated in newborns, especially males, whose mothers were characterized by MS Fe higher than 400 μg/dL compared to those of mothers with MS Fe up to 300 μg/dL (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Moreover, a negative correlation between the MS Cu and UCS 3'NT in male newborns was observed (rho = -0.509, <i>p</i> = 0.008). Results of the study showed the need to develop strategies to optimize the nutritional status of pregnant women. Implementation of these strategies could contribute to reducing the risk of pre- and neonatal OS and its adverse health effects in the offspring."
