    "<h4>Aims</h4>The present study aimed at analysing the proteome pattern of the leaf blade of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in Serendipita indica-colonised plants to decipher the molecular mechanism of S. indica-mediated salt stress. This work is aligned with our previous research on barley leaf sheath to study proteomic pattern variability in leaf blade and sheath of barley plant in response to salinity and S. indica inoculation.<h4>Methods and results</h4>The experiment was conducted using a completely randomised factorial design with four replications and two treatments: salinity (0 and 300 mmol l<sup>-1</sup> NaCl) and fungus (noninoculated and S. indica-inoculated). The leaf blades of the salt-treated S. indica-colonised and noninoculated plants were harvested after 2 weeks of salt treatment for the physiological and proteomic analyses. After exposure to 300 mmol l<sup>-1</sup> NaCl, shoot dry matter production in noninoculated control plants decreased 84% which was about twofold higher than inoculated plants with S. indica. However, the accumulation of sodium in the shoot of S. indica-inoculated plants was significantly lower than the control plants. Analysis of the proteome profile revealed a high number of significantly up-regulated proteins involved in photosynthesis (26 out of 42 identified proteins).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results demonstrated how the enhanced plant growth and salt stress resistance induced by S. indica was positively associated with the up-regulation of several proteins involved in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. In fact, S. indica improved photosynthesis in order to reach the best possible performance of the host plant under salt stress.<h4>Significance and impact of the study</h4>Current research provides new insight into the mechanism applied by S. indica in reducing the negative impacts of salt stress in barley at physiological and molecular levels."
