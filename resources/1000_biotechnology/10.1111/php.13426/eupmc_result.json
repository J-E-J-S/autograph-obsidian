    "This study describes the relation of photosynthetic capacity, growth and biochemical compounds in the microalgae Porphyridium cruentum under saturated irradiance (200 μmol m<sup>-2</sup>  s<sup>-1</sup> ) by white light (WL) and low-pressure sodium vapor lamps (SOX lamps-control) and supplemented by fluorescent lamps (FLs) with different light qualities (blue: λ<sub>max</sub> = 440 nm; green: λ<sub>max</sub> = 560 nm; and red: λ<sub>max</sub> = 660 nm). The maximum photosynthetic efficiency (F<sub>v</sub> / F<sub>m</sub> ) showed a positive correlation with the light quality by saturating light SOX in mixture with stimulating blue light than the white light (WL) at the harvest day (10 days). The production, that is maximal electron transport rate (ETR<sub>max</sub> ), and energy dissipation, that is maximal nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ<sub>max</sub> ), had the same pattern throughout the time (3-6 days) being the values higher under white light (WL) compared with SOX and SOX plus supplemented different light qualities. Total protein levels increased significantly in the presence of SOX light, while phycoerythrin (B-PE) showed significant differences under SOX+ blue light. Arachidonic acid (ARA) was higher under SOX and SOX plus supplemented different light qualities than that under WL, whereas eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was the reverse. The high photomorphogenic potential by SOX light shows promising application for microalgal biotechnology."
