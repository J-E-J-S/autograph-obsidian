    "Common buckwheat sprout (CBS) contains more flavone <i>C</i>-glycosides (FCGs) and flavonol <i>O</i>-glycosides (FOGs) than does common buckwheat seed. Both flavonoids in CBS are well known for providing benefits to human health. However, they are relatively less bioaccessible and more directly degradable to aglycone during digestion than are multiglycosylated flavonoids. To overcome such limitations, the water solubility and digestion stability of FCGs and FOGs were enhanced by transglycosylation using cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase. Gastric conditions had little effect on the stability of FCGs and FOGs and their enzyme-modified compounds. In contrast, under intestinal conditions, transglycosylated FCGs lost a glucose moiety and reverted to their parent compounds before transglycosylation. Under colonic fermentation using human fecal samples, the different profiles and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were suggested to be mainly due to the presence of transglycosylated FCGs and FOGs. These findings indicate that the process of transglycosylation changes the bioaccessibility of flavonoids in CBS."
